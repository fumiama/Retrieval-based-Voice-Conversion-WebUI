> The dataset for the pre-training model uses nearly 50 hours of high quality audio from the VCTK open source dataset.

> High quality licensed song datasets will be added to the training-set often for your use, without having to worry about copyright infringement.

> Please look forward to the pretrained base model of RVCv3, which has larger parameters, more training data, better results, unchanged inference speed, and requires less training data for training.

## Features:
+ Reduce tone leakage by replacing the source feature to training-set feature using top1 retrieval;
+ Easy + fast training, even on poor graphics cards;
+ Training with a small amounts of data (>=10min low noise speech recommended);
+ Model fusion to change timbres (using ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge);
+ Easy-to-use WebUI;
+ UVR5 model to quickly separate vocals and instruments;
+ High-pitch Voice Extraction Algorithm [InterSpeech2023-RMVPE](#Credits) to prevent a muted sound problem. Provides the best results (significantly) and is faster with lower resource consumption than Crepe_full;
+ AMD/Intel graphics cards acceleration supported;
+ Intel ARC graphics cards acceleration with IPEX supported.

## Preparing the environment
The following commands need to be executed with Python 3.8 or higher.

(Windows/Linux)
First install the main dependencies through pip:
```bash
# Install PyTorch-related core dependencies, skip if installed
# Reference: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

#For Windows + Nvidia Ampere Architecture(RTX30xx), you need to specify the cuda version corresponding to pytorch according to the experience of https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/issues/21
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

#For Linux + AMD Cards, you need to use the following pytorch versions:
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2
```

Then can use poetry to install the other dependencies:
```bash
# Install the Poetry dependency management tool, skip if installed
# Reference: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install the project dependencies
poetry install
```

You can also use pip to install them:
```bash

for Nvidia graphics cards
  pip install -r requirements.txt

for AMD/Intel graphics cards on Windows (DirectML)ï¼š
  pip install -r requirements-dml.txt

for Intel ARC graphics cards on Linux / WSL using Python 3.10: 
  pip install -r requirements-ipex.txt

for AMD graphics cards on Linux (ROCm):
  pip install -r requirements-amd.txt
```

------
Mac users can install dependencies via `run.sh`:
```bash
sh ./run.sh
```

## Preparation of other Pre-models
RVC requires other pre-models to infer and train.

```bash
#Download all needed models from https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/
python tools/download_models.py
```

Or just download them by yourself from our [Huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/tree/main/).

Here's a list of Pre-models and other files that RVC needs:
```bash
./assets/hubert/hubert_base.pt

./assets/pretrained 

./assets/uvr5_weights

Additional downloads are required if you want to test the v2 version of the model.

./assets/pretrained_v2

If you want to test the v2 version model (the v2 version model has changed the input from the 256 dimensional feature of 9-layer Hubert+final_proj to the 768 dimensional feature of 12-layer Hubert, and has added 3 period discriminators), you will need to download additional features

./assets/pretrained_v2

If you want to use the latest SOTA RMVPE vocal pitch extraction algorithm, you need to download the RMVPE weights and place them in the RVC root directory

https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/rmvpe.pt

    For AMD/Intel graphics cards users you need download:

    https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/rmvpe.onnx

```

### 2. Install FFmpeg
If you have FFmpeg and FFprobe installed on your computer, you can skip this step.

#### For Ubuntu/Debian users
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
#### For MacOS users
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
#### For Windows users
Download these files and place them in the root folder:
- [ffmpeg.exe](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/ffmpeg.exe)

- [ffprobe.exe](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/blob/main/ffprobe.exe)

## ROCm Support for AMD graphic cards (Linux only)
To use ROCm on Linux install all required drivers as described [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/os-native/install.html).

On Arch use pacman to install the driver:
````
pacman -S rocm-hip-sdk rocm-opencl-sdk
````

You might also need to set these environment variables (e.g. on a RX6700XT):
````
export ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm #Set ROCM Executables Path
export HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0 #Spoof GPU Model for ROCM
````

And overwrite PyTorch with its ROCM version after installing dependencies.
````
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2
````

Make sure your user is part of the `render` and `video` group:
````
sudo usermod -aG render $USERNAME
sudo usermod -aG video $USERNAME
````

## Get started
### start up directly
Use the following command to start WebUI:
```bash
python infer-web.py
```
### Use the integration package
Download and extract file `RVC-beta.7z`, then follow the steps below according to your system:
#### For Windows users
Double click `go-web.bat`
#### For MacOS users
```bash
sh ./run.sh
```
### For Intel IPEX users (Linux Only)
```bash
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```
